    description:

      - State of the pagefile: present, absent, query.
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
      - query
    default: query
notes:
- There is difference between automatic managed pagefiles that configured once for the entire system and system managed pagefile that configured per pagefile.
- InitialSize 0 and MaximumSize 0 means the pagefile is managed by the system.
- "Value out of range" exception may be caused by several different issues, two common problems:
  - No such drive.
  - Pagefile size is too small.
- Setting a pagefile when automatic managed pagefile is on will disable it.
